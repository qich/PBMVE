      Number using O5 and O6:                   75
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  70,200    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1

      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          526
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           328 out of     526   62%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of     526    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         193 out of     526   36%
    Number of unique control sets:              18
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              62 out of 408,000    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
